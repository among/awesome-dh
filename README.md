# awesome-dh
Starting point for exploring computer-supported solutions for the Humanities (including but not exclusive manuscript studies).

This will become an [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re) list of resources. This a community effort so your contributions are welcome and indeed needed! 

To add to the list, join GitHub and learn enough of ```git``` so that you can do what is called a ```pull request```. This will make it easier to maintain this list.

**Note that this list is structured in the following manner: We divide questions in *beginner*, *intermediate*, and *advanced* categories. Within those categories the resources are grouped under questions.***
If you are unsure which category to do pull-request your contribution to, chose whichever and make a note of it. No problem. Be sure to formulate your contribution as a question and answer and not a 'Jeopardy question' but something that makes sense.
